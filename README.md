## Responsive portfolio

In this repository you will find three HTML and one CSS doucments.  The finished product is a working portfolio that can be maintained and updated to display work from the bootcamp.  The main objective was to make a responsive app that looks and functions appropriately on any screen size or device.  

To achieve this the web site uses a Bootstrap grid layout, utilizing many bootstrap components that have been custom modified and styled to fit the content and desired appearance.  

The first page is the Home page that is also a brief bio about myself.  The second page is a portfolio archive that will be filled in as projects are completed.  The intent is to maintain this website as a way to show off my skills.  the final page is a contact page witha repsonsive form.  The form has the ability to be filled out by the perosn interacting with the site.
